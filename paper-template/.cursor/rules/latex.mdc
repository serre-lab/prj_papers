# LaTeX Compilation Rules

When working with LaTeX files (`**/*.tex`):

- **Always use Tectonic for compilation**: Use `make pdf` which runs `tectonic -o build main.tex`
- **Never suggest latexmk or pdflatex** unless the user explicitly asks for them
- The compilation command is: `tectonic -o build main.tex`
- Output PDF is written to `build/main.pdf`

If compilation errors occur:
- Read the error messages carefully
- Fix the minimal issue needed to resolve the error
- Recompile to verify the fix
