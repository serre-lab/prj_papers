Publish the paper: compile with tectonic, then commit & push sources to GitHub if applicable.

Steps:
1) Run `make publish` (or `./scripts/publish.sh` if Makefile is not present).
2) If compilation fails, fix the minimal issue and retry.
3) Report: did it commit? did it push? (git repo? origin set?)
