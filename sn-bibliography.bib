@article{wilf2021dataset,
	abstract = {Leaves are the most abundant and visible plant organ, both in the modern world and the fossil record. Identifying foliage to the correct plant family based on leaf architecture is a fundamental botanical skill that is also critical for isolated fossil leaves, which often, especially in the Cenozoic, represent extinct genera and species from extant families. Resources focused on leaf identification are remarkably scarce; however, the situation has improved due to the recent proliferation of digitized herbarium material, live-plant identification applications, and online collections of cleared and fossil leaf images. Nevertheless, the need remains for a specialized image dataset for comparative leaf architecture. We address this gap by assembling an open-access database of 30,252 images of vouchered leaf specimens vetted to family level, primarily of angiosperms, including 26,176 images of cleared and x-rayed leaves representing 354 families and 4,076 of fossil leaves from 48 families. The images maintain original resolution, have user-friendly filenames, and are vetted using APG and modern paleobotanical standards. The cleared and x-rayed leaves include the Jack A. Wolfe and Leo J. Hickey contributions to the National Cleared Leaf Collection and a collection of high-resolution scanned x-ray negatives, housed in the Division of Paleobotany, Department of Paleobiology, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington D.C.; and the Daniel I. Axelrod Cleared Leaf Collection, housed at the University of California Museum of Paleontology, Berkeley. The fossil images include a sampling of Late Cretaceous to Eocene paleobotanical sites from the Western Hemisphere held at numerous institutions, especially from Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument (late Eocene, Colorado), as well as several other localities from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene of the Western USA and the early Paleogene of Colombia and southern Argentina. The dataset facilitates new research and education opportunities in paleobotany, comparative leaf architecture, systematics, and machine learning.},

abstract = {Understanding the extremely variable, complex shape and venation characters of angiosperm leaves is one of the most challenging problems in botany. Machine learning offers opportunities to analyze large numbers of specimens, to discover novel leaf features of angiosperm clades that may have phylogenetic significance, and to use those characters to classify unknowns. Previous computer vision approaches have primarily focused on leaf identification at the species level. It remains an open question whether learning and classification are possible among major evolutionary groups such as families and orders, which usually contain hundreds to thousands of species each and exhibit many times the foliar variation of individual species. Here, we tested whether a computer vision algorithm could use a database of 7,597 leaf images from 2,001 genera to learn features of botanical families and orders, then classify novel images. The images are of cleared leaves, specimens that are chemically bleached, then stained to reveal venation. Machine learning was used to learn a codebook of visual elements representing leaf shape and venation patterns. The resulting automated system learned to classify images into families and orders with a success rate many times greater than chance. Of direct botanical interest, the responses of diagnostic features can be visualized on leaf images as heat maps, which are likely to prompt recognition and evolutionary interpretation of a wealth of novel morphological characters. With assistance from computer vision, leaves are poised to make numerous new contributions to systematic and paleobotanical studies.}}

abstract = {Abstract Accurate species identification is the basis for all aspects of taxonomic research and is an essential component of workflows in biological research. Biologists are asking for more efficient methods to meet the identification demand. Smart mobile devices, digital cameras as well as the mass digitisation of natural history collections led to an explosion of openly available image data depicting living organisms. This rapid increase in biological image data in combination with modern machine learning methods, such as deep learning, offers tremendous opportunities for automated species identification. In this paper, we focus on deep learning neural networks as a technology that enabled breakthroughs in automated species identification in the last 2 years. In order to stimulate more work in this direction, we provide a brief overview of machine learning frameworks applicable to the species identification problem. We review selected deep learning approaches for image based species identification and introduce publicly available applications. Eventually, this article aims to provide insights into the current state-of-the-art in automated identification and to serve as a starting point for researchers willing to apply novel machine learning techniques in their biological studies. While modern machine learning approaches only slowly pave their way into the field of species identification, we argue that we are going to see a proliferation of these techniques being applied to the problem in the future. Artificial intelligence systems will provide alternative tools for taxonomic identification in the near future.},

abstract = "We employ triplet loss as a feature embedding regularizer to boost classification performance. Standard architectures, like ResNet and Inception, are extended to support both losses with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. This promotes generality while fine-tuning pretrained networks. Triplet loss is a powerful surrogate for recently proposed embedding regularizers. Yet, it is avoided due to large batch-size requirement and high computational cost. Through our experiments, we re-assess these assumptions.During inference, our network supports both classification and embedding tasks without any computational overhead. Quantitative evaluation highlights a steady improvement on five fine-grained recognition datasets. Further evaluation on an imbalanced video dataset achieves significant improvement. Triplet loss brings feature embedding capabilities like nearest neighbor to classification models. Code available at http://bit.ly/2LNYEqL.",

@article{Dilcher_1971, title={Revision of the eocene flora of southeastern north America.}, volume={20}, url={https://jpsonline.co.in/index.php/jop/article/view/882}, DOI={10.54991/jop.1971.882}, abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Lower Eocene floras of southeastern North America were first published as a comprehensive flora by E. W. Berry in 1916 and later revised by him in 1930. This flora is one of the largest and most completely studied Eocene floras in North America. However, reinvestigation, presently in progress, has resulted in several revisions. Improved methods of research, more detailed and inclusive study expanding into new areas of research, and the increased understanding that has resulted from continued study in previously established areas of research, as well as the recent remapping of important deposits and the continued collection of fossil material, have provided the tools and information necessary for this revision. The age of these deposits has been revised from Wilcox group (Lower Eocene) to Claiborne group (Middle Eocene) and the nature of the deposits may now best be considered to be leaf-bearing clays laid down in ancient oxbow lakes. Recent studies of the cuticular remains of some leaves and pollen indicate that the clay pits are not isochronous but span the range of time of the Middle Eocene.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Work which has been completed indicates that at least 60% of the taxonomic relationships of fossil forms to modern families and genera published by Berry are incorrect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the fine venation and cuticular remains of the leaves are examined the presence of several extant taxa which Berry reported cannot be substantiated. Some taxonomic revisions are proposed; some of the fossil leaves studied could not be assigned to any known taxa and may represent extinct forms. The evolution of the angiosperms in the early Tertiary is often misunderstood because of the excessive number of extant generic and family names that are applied to fossil leaves with little or no detailed analysis of the fine venation or cuticular features of either modern or fossil angiosperms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The use of taxonomic affinities, community structure, and foliar physiognomy in making palaeoecological interpretations of early Tertiary floras is mentioned and the climate during Middle Eocene time in western Kentucky and Tennessee is reevaluated. The climate appears to have been dryer and somewhat cooler than previous investigators indicated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={1-3}, journal={Journal of Palaeosciences}, author={Dilcher, D.L.}, year={1971}, month={Dec.}, pages={7–18} }
